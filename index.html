                    movies we stream, code enables everyday actions in our lives. Tech companies are no longer
                    recognizable as just software companies — instead, they bring food to our door, help us get a taxi,
                    influence outcomes in presidential elections, or act as a personal trainer.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Computer programming is the process of performing a particular
                computation (or more generally, accomplishing a specific computing result), usually by designing and
                building an executable computer program. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating
                algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of
                algorithms (usually in a chosen programming language, commonly referred to as coding).The source
                code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than
                machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is
                to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex
                as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus
                usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain,
                specialized algorithms, and formal logic. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Tasks accompanying and related to programming include testing,
                debugging, source code maintenance, implementation of build systems, and management of derived
                artifacts, such as the machine code of computer programs. These might be considered part of the
                programming process, but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the
                term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual writing of code. Software
                engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices. Reverse engineering is
                a related process used by designers, analysts, and programmers to understand an existing program and
                re-implement its function</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Programmable devices have existed for centuries. As early as the 9th
                century, a programmable music sequencer was invented by the Persian Banu Musa brothers, who described an
                automated mechanical flute player in the Book of Ingenious Devices. In 1206, the Arab engineer
                Al-Jazari invented a programmable drum machine where a musical mechanical automaton could be made to
                play different rhythms and drum patterns, via pegs and cams. In 1801, the Jacquard loom could
                produce entirely different weaves by changing the "program" a series of pasteboard cards with holes
                punched in them.</p>
